usage: put it in your ~/bin (or somewhere that's on system path) directory
set executable if necessary
use it to open programs from the command line & detach them so you don't see their output
I find it convenient for IDEs & file explorers
It's almost like 'open' on OS X, except you have to specify the file explorer for a directory
